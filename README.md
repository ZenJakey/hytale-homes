# Hytale Homes

Adds 4 commands
`/sethome [name]` - sets the current location as home "name"
`/homes - lists` all homes that you have
`/home [name]` - teleports you to home "name"
`/delhome [name]` - deletes the home "name"

There is a config file to change how many homes each player can have, and the teleport delay to them.
